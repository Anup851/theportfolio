Got it üëç You want a prompt that you can use in an AI website builder/code generator (like ChatGPT, Cursor, v0.dev, or any AI website creator) to generate a complete portfolio website.

Here‚Äôs a clean and detailed prompt you can use:

üé® Prompt for Portfolio Website
"Create a modern, responsive personal portfolio website using React.js (with Tailwind CSS for styling). The website should have the following sections:

Hero Section ‚Äì My name, profession (Frontend Developer), a short tagline, and call-to-action buttons (e.g., Download Resume, Contact Me).

About Me Section ‚Äì A short bio, profile image, and skills summary.

Projects Section ‚Äì A grid/list of my projects with images, descriptions, tech stack, and links to GitHub/demo.

Skills Section ‚Äì Icons or progress bars showing technical skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, etc.).

Experience/Education Section ‚Äì Timeline or cards showing my work/education history.

Contact Section ‚Äì Contact form with name, email, and message fields, plus social media links (LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter).

Footer ‚Äì Copyright, quick links, and social icons.

Design preferences:

Clean, professional, and minimal UI (similar to modern portfolio templates).

Use Tailwind CSS for styling with smooth animations (Framer Motion if possible).

Responsive layout (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Dark/Light mode toggle option.

Code requirements:

Use functional React components.

Organize components (Hero.jsx, About.jsx, Projects.jsx, etc.).

Export App.jsx as the main file with routing if needed.

Include sample data/content so I can replace it later with my own details."

‚ö° You can copy-paste this prompt into ChatGPT, Cursor, or any AI coding tool, and it will generate the whole portfolio website for you.

Do you want me to make it directly in React code for you right now (with all sections ready), or just keep it as a prompt?
